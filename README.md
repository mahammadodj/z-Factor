# z-Factor
Gas compressibility factor (z-Factor) is one of the most important parameters in upstream and downstream calculations of petroleum industries. The compressibility factor (z-factor) of gases is a thermodynamic property used to account for the deviation of real gas behavior from that of an ideal gas. Correlations based on the equation of state are often implicit, because they require iteration and are computationally expensive. 
I created Real gas z-factor, as attributed to Standing and Katz, plotted as a function of the pseudoreduced density function chart using Python.
